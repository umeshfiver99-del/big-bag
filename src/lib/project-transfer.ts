 * ═══ EXPORT · IMPORT · CLONE (Feature H8) ═══════════════════════════════════
 *
 * The rules behind the three transfer flows, kept out of the components so the
 * credit arithmetic and the error mapping can be tested without a browser.
 *
 * ── THE CALLING SEQUENCE, FROM THE OFFICIAL REFERENCE ───────────────────────
 *
 *   export : POST …/{source}/export   → { importCode }        2 credits
 *   create : POST /projects                                    1 credit
 *   import : POST …/{target}/import   → returns IMMEDIATELY    6 credits
 *   poll   : GET  /projects/{target}  until agentServerStatus = "Active"
 *
 * ⚠️ IMPORT IS ASYNC AND THE 200 MEANS "STARTED", NOT "DONE". The restore and
 * rebuild take minutes after the call returns. A UI that closes on the response
 * would tell the user their clone is ready while it is still an empty project.
 *
 * ⚠️ BOTH ENDPOINTS ARE RATE-LIMITED TO 1/MINUTE AND 5/HOUR. Nothing here may
 * auto-retry: one failed export retried three times burns the minute limit and
 * turns a recoverable error into `PROJECT_EXPORT_LIMIT_REACHED`.
 *
 * Pure module: no React, no fetch. Unit-tested by `src/lib/__tests__/transfer.test.ts`.

 * ⚠️⚠️ THE IN-DIALOG POLL IS GONE, AND SO ARE ITS TWO CONSTANTS.

 * `IMPORT_POLL_MS` / `IMPORT_TIMEOUT_MS` used to watch the target project from
 * inside the import and clone dialogs for up to twelve minutes. That put the whole
 * progress of an import in a modal's React state, which **died on reload** — refresh
 * mid-clone and there was no loader, no explanation, and a workspace that looked idle
 * over a project being rebuilt underneath it.
 *
 * Both dialogs now hand off the moment `POST …/import` returns 200: they stamp the
 * new project's operation slot and navigate to it, and the workspace's import overlay
 * takes over. That overlay is driven by `project.importInProgress` — a lock held and
 * dated by the SERVER — so it survives a reload, a second tab and another device.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE TIMING NOW LIVES IN ONE PLACE: `OPERATION_PROFILES.import` in
 * `@/lib/project-operation`. Do not reintroduce a second set of numbers here; a poll
 * interval and a give-up window that disagree with the workspace's are exactly how
 * two parts of the product start telling different stories about one import.
