/**
 * ═══ THE TIERED RESOLVER ═══════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * ⚠️⚠️ SERVER ONLY, AND THAT IS A HARD CONSTRAINT RATHER THAN A CONVENTION. This
 * module reaches `visual-edit-source.ts`, which loads **the TypeScript compiler** to
 * parse TSX. `visual-edit.ts` is imported by the inspector panel and the changes bar,
 * so putting any of this in there would drag a 10 MB parser into the browser bundle of
 * every workspace page. The split is what keeps the client bundle exactly as it was.
 *
 * ── WHY THERE ARE FOUR TIERS ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A user applied twelve changes to a real project and was told:
 *
 *     2 changes written to 1 file.
 *     10 changes could not be placed:
 *       · we couldn't find that exact text in the source
 *       · we weren't confident enough in the match to change it
 *       · it appears in several places and we can't tell which you meant
 *
 * All three sentences, one batch. They are three symptoms of one cause — the old
 * matcher compared the RENDERED string against the SOURCE text — and each tier below
 * removes a class of that failure:
 *
 *   1 · **The build tag.** Nothing to compare: the element says where it was written.
 *   2 · **Structure.** Compare trees, not strings. Understands `cn()`, `cva`,
 *       template literals, `&apos;`, collapsed whitespace, components and lists, and
 *       accepts a unique match instead of demanding an arbitrary score.
 *   3 · **The data.** The copy behind a `.map()` lives in an array, not in the markup.
 *   4 · **The original regex matcher**, untouched, for whatever the parser could not
 *       read. It is consulted last and never overrides a higher tier.

 * ⭐⭐⭐ UNDO THE BATCH'S OWN DRIFT BEFORE TRYING TO MATCH.
 *
 * ⚠️⚠️ EVERY CHANGE IS APPLIED TO THE LIVE PREVIEW THE MOMENT IT IS MADE — that is the
 * point of a visual editor — so the page the user is looking at stops being the page the
 * files describe. Select an element after recolouring it and the signature reports
 * `text-[#cf5230]`, a token that is in no file. Select its neighbour and the signature's
 * `parentClassName` is drifted. Retype a heading and every sibling that mentions it in
 * `prevSiblingText` is drifted too.
 *
 * That is not a nuisance, it is actively dangerous: the matcher DISQUALIFIES a candidate
 * whose text or classes disagree with the DOM, so drift makes the one correct element
 * look wrong. Twelve changes means eleven chances for it to happen.
 *
 * The batch carries the cure. Every change knows the value BEFORE it was made, so a
 * reverse lookup over the whole batch turns any drifted value back into what the file
 * says. It is exact-string keyed and idempotent: a value nothing in the batch touched is
 * returned unchanged.
