 * — unit-testable, and testable is the point: the option-colour function has to
 * be stable across renders, pages and sessions, which is easy to claim and easy
 * to get wrong.

 * ⚠️ LIGHT TINTS ONLY, AND ALL THE SAME WEIGHT.
 *
 * These are `--data-*` — the design system's own categorical ramp, the one the
 * usage charts use — at a low alpha over the surface, with the text left as
 * `foreground`. Full-strength categorical colours as badge backgrounds would need
 * white text, and a row of eight saturated pills reads as an alert panel rather
 * than as data. The brief asked for light colours; this is also the only version
 * that stays legible in both themes without a second palette.

 * length and an alphabet, which is exactly what an options column holds, correlate
 * modulo the small factors of a composite. The same six over a prime take eleven
