/**
 * Totalum API — the CLIENT CATALOG: one documented function per endpoint, each
 * mapped to a same-origin `/api/vcaas/*` proxy route.
 *
 * 📖 THE API REFERENCE FOR EVERY ENDPOINT IN THIS FILE:
 *    https://www.totalum.app/totalum-api.md
 *    (one Markdown file with the whole core API; it links to the optional areas —
 *    GitHub, Figma, database, webhooks, files, project transfer, project groups).
 *    Read it before adding or changing a function here. Do not vendor a copy.
 *
 * The client and server halves live in two files, and the split is a FILE BOUNDARY
 * on purpose:
 *
 *   ┌─ CLIENT LAYER — THIS FILE ─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
 *   │  `vcaasApi`. UI components import this and never hardcode an            │
 *   │  `/api/vcaas/...` path. Same-origin fetch, NO credential, no env var,   │
 *   │  no reference to any module that holds either.                          │
 *   └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
 *                                    │  (same-origin request, no credential)
 *                                    ▼
 *   ┌─ SERVER LAYER — `vcaas-server.ts` ─────────────────────────────────────┐
 *   │  `vcaasRequest` / `vcaasUploadRequest`. `server-only`. The ONLY code    │
 *   │  that reads the API key and calls the Totalum API. Imported exclusively │
 *   │  by `src/app/api/vcaas/*`.                                              │
 *   └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
 *
 * ⚠️ WHY A FILE BOUNDARY AND NOT A COMMENT. A single module holding both layers and
 * importing the server half lazily (`await import(...)`) does NOT keep it out of
 * client bundles — Webpack traces dynamic imports statically, so the first
 * `"use client"` component to import `vcaasApi` fails the production build with
 * "You're importing a component that needs server-only". Keeping the key-holding
 * code in its own `server-only` module is what makes the guarantee structural.
 *
 * KEEP THIS FILE FREE OF: `process.env` reads, `crypto`, `node:*` imports, and any
 * import of `@/lib/vcaas-server`.
