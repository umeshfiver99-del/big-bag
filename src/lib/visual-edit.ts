/**
 * ═══ THE VISUAL EDITOR: MODEL AND MATCHER (the visual editor) ═════════════════════
 *
 * The pure half — no React, no fetch, no DOM. It answers one hard question:
 *
 *   **A user changed something in a rendered page. Which characters in which
 *   source file produced it?**
 *
 * ⚠️⚠️ THERE IS NO SOURCE MAP TO ASK. The preview is a PRODUCTION `next start`
 * build: no React DevTools source info, no `__source` props, no dev overlay. So the
 * mapping is reconstructed from SIGNALS — the text itself, the class attribute, the
 * siblings around it, the parent, the position among same-tag siblings, and the
 * route the user was on. Any one of them is weak; together they identify an
 * occurrence with enough confidence to edit it, and — just as importantly — to
 * REFUSE when they do not.
 *
 * ⭐ THE SCORING IS PORTED FROM THE LEGACY ANGULAR EDITOR
 * (`totalum-frontend/src/app/features/startum/services/visual-editor/`), which
 * solved this exact problem against these exact generated projects. Re-deriving it
 * would have meant re-learning its lessons in production. The weights below are its
 * weights; what is new here is that a low score REFUSES instead of guessing.
 *
 * Unit-tested by `src/lib/__tests__/visual-edit.test.ts`.

 * ═══ CLASS NAMES WRITTEN AS TEMPLATE LITERALS ══════════════════════════

 * and 6 of this shape —
 *
 *     className={`text-5xl md:text-7xl tracking-tight text-stone-900 ${fraunces.className}`}

 * reaches for first. `findClassCandidates` matches a QUOTED attribute value, so all six
 * came back "we couldn't find that exact text in the source" and the whole feature was
 * useless on the elements that matter most.
 *
 * Two things have to be true at once for this to be safe:
 *
 *  1. THE SOURCE AND THE DOM DO NOT AGREE, and the source is right. The DOM carries
 *     `__className_0d86af` — what `${fraunces.className}` evaluated to. Writing the DOM
 *     string back would bake a build-hash into someone's source and delete their font.
 *     So only the STATIC text is rewritten, and the interpolations are not touched.
 *
 *  2. WE MUST STILL BE ABLE TO PROVE THE MATCH. Whole-string equality is gone, so
 *     containment replaces it: every static token must be present in the rendered
 *     class list, and the rendered list may hold only a few tokens the source does not
 *     explain (those the interpolations produced). A literal that fails either test is
