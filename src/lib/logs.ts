/**
 * ═══ THE TWO LOG STREAMS ═══════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * ⚠️⚠️ THEY ARE GENUINELY DIFFERENT RUNTIMES, AND PHASE 09 GOT THIS WRONG.
 * That phase shipped one tab on the assumption that "the dev server on PORT 80
 * serves both the preview and the published site", so one endpoint covered
 * everything. It does not, and the code says so:
 *
 *   · **Dev** — `GET …/backend/dev/logs` → `totalum-backend`'s
 *     `getStartumBackendDevLogs`, which is literally
 *     `cat /app/user-project/npm-start.log` **on the sandbox VM**. It is the dev
 *     server's stdout/stderr and nothing else.
 *   · **Production** — `GET …/backend/prod/logs` → `getProdLogs`, which POSTs to a
 *     **Cloudflare Logpush worker** and returns its records verbatim. A published
 *     project runs on Cloudflare (`deploy-to-cloudflare`), so its request logs
 *     exist ONLY here — they never touch the sandbox.
 *
 * So someone debugging their live site on the old single tab was reading the wrong
 * machine. That is the bug F9 fixes; the copy in `workspace.logs.*` was corrected
 * in the same pass.
 *
 * This module is PURE — no fetch, no React. It turns either source into the same
 * `LogLine[]`, so one renderer, one search, one copy/download path serves both.

 * `workspace.logs.*` promises three days. A site whose last visitor was this
 * morning read as "nothing from production yet", and the user had no control to
 * widen it: unlike the legacy Angular panel, there were no date pickers here.
 *
 * ⚠️ `getOnlyLastLogs` DOES NOT DO THIS. It is forwarded faithfully by
 * account-backend and totalum-backend and then **ignored by the worker** — it
 * reads `body.query` and nothing else. Sending it is harmless; relying on it to
