/**
 * ═══ GIVING AN EXISTING PROJECT THE EXACT TIER ═════════════════
 *
 * New projects are generated from a template whose webpack config stamps every JSX
 * element with `data-tlm-loc="file:line:col"`, and for those the visual editor never
 * has to infer anything. Projects created before that shipped carry their own copy of
 * `next.config.ts` and would stay on structural matching forever.
 *
 * This installs the loader into one of those projects: two files, written through the
 * same endpoint every visual edit already uses, picked up by the rebuild that the apply
 * was going to run anyway. From the next apply onwards, that project resolves exactly.
 *
 * ── THE RULES IT FOLLOWS, AND WHY EACH ONE IS THERE ─────────────────────────
 *
 * ⚠️⚠️ IT REFUSES ANY CONFIG IT DOES NOT RECOGNISE. Patching a build config is the one
 * change here that can take an app off the air, and a `next.config.ts` the user (or the
 * agent) has rewritten is not something to pattern-match hopefully. The shape has to be
 * the template's own `webpack: (config, { dev }) => {`; anything else is skipped and
 * reported, and the editor carries on inferring exactly as before.
 *
 * ⚠️⚠️ THE LOADER FILE IS WRITTEN FIRST, AND THE CONFIG ONLY IF THAT SUCCEEDED. The
 * failure to avoid is a config that points at a loader which is not there — that is not
 * a degraded editor, it is a build that cannot run at all.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT IS IDEMPOTENT. Both writes are skipped when the project already has them, so a
 * retry, a second apply or a concurrent session cannot double-patch a file.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT IS NEVER REQUIRED. Every failure path returns a status and nothing else; the
 * apply that triggered it does not fail, does not warn the user, and does not retry.
 */

/**
 * The loader, as it will be written into the project.
 *
 * ⚠️⚠️ THIS IS A SECOND COPY OF `nextjs-startum-template/scripts/totalum-source-tags.js`
 * AND THE TWO MUST AGREE. It cannot be imported: the template is a different repository
 * that is not present at runtime, and the file has to travel to the sandbox as text.
 * The contract it implements — anchor on the `<`, 1-based line and column, relative
 * POSIX path — is what `findByLoc` looks elements up by, so a divergence would silently
 * demote every project it touches back to the inference tier.
