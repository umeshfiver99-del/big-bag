/**
 * ═══ HOW LONG A RUN HAS BEEN GOING, AND WHETHER IT IS STUCK ═════════════════
 *
 * The agent reports `init` or `done` and nothing in between — no percentage, no
 * step count, no estimate. So everything the chat can say about progress has to be
 * derived from two facts: when the run started, and how many build steps have
 * arrived. This module owns that arithmetic, and it is pure so the two judgements
 * that matter can be tested instead of watched for twenty-five minutes:
 *
 *   · the bar never claims to be finished when it is not;
 *   · "the agent looks stuck" is only ever said when it really might be.
 *
 * ── WHY 4 TO 10 MINUTES ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * ⚠️⚠️ THIS USED TO SAY "6 to ~25 min" AND IT WAS WRONG BY A FACTOR OF THREE.
 * Real runs land between four and ten minutes; quoting twenty-five made the bar
 * crawl (a five-minute run finished at 20 %, which reads as "barely started") and
 * made every honest estimate look like a broken one. The range is now the one we
 * actually observe, and it is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH: the chat's bar fills
 * against `RUN_ESTIMATE_MS`, the first-build loader's phase table is weighted
 * against the same number (see `STAGE_WEIGHTS` in `first-run.ts`), and the copy
 * beside both quotes `RUN_ESTIMATE_MIN_MS` → `RUN_ESTIMATE_MS`.
 *
 * It is the ESTIMATE, not a promise. A bar that fills in five minutes and then
 * sits at 100 % for five more is the specific lie users hate most, so this one is
 * capped short of the end (see `PROGRESS_CEILING`) and says "longer than usual"
 * out loud when the estimate is passed rather than pretending it was right.
 */

/** The estimate the bar fills against. Not a timeout — nothing is cancelled. */
export const RUN_ESTIMATE_MS = 10 * 60_000;

/**
 * ⭐ THE FLOOR OF THE RANGE THE UI QUOTES: "4 to 10 min".
 *
 * ⚠️ IT IS A LABEL, NOT A SECOND ESTIMATE — nothing computes against it. The bar
 * still fills against `RUN_ESTIMATE_MS` and still stops at `PROGRESS_CEILING`,
 * because the honest shape of this is one long estimate, not a two-point forecast.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHY QUOTE A FLOOR AT ALL. "10 min" alone reads as "this will take 10
 * minutes", so a run that finishes in four looks like a broken estimate and a run
 * at 3:18 looks a third done when it may be nearly finished. A range says the true
 * thing: most runs land somewhere in a window, and the number beside the clock is
 * not a countdown.

/**
 * ═══⭐⭐⭐ THE ESTIMATE EXTENDS ITSELF WHEN A RUN OUTLIVES IT ════════════════
 *
 * ⚠️⚠️ A SINGLE FIXED ESTIMATE HAS EXACTLY ONE FAILURE MODE, AND IT IS THE ONE
 * PEOPLE SEE. A run that passes ten minutes used to hit "Longer than usual" and
 * stay there — for another twenty minutes, with the bar frozen at 97 % and no
 * number moving. At that point the UI has stopped telling the user anything at
 * all, which is precisely when they reload or give up on the run.
 *
 * So the estimate is a LADDER, not a constant. Each rung says "once the run has
 * been going this long, the realistic remaining window is that long" — the number
 * beside the clock keeps moving, and the overrun copy is held back for a run that
 * is genuinely extraordinary rather than merely long.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT IS NOT A TIMEOUT AND NOTHING IS CANCELLED. Every number here is a label.
 * The run ends when the agent says it ends.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE LAST RUNG IS THE END OF THE LADDER. Past `45 min` the estimate stops
 * growing and `overrun` finally fires — a run that long IS longer than usual, and
 * saying so is the honest thing.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE `20 → 23` RUNG WAS SPECIFIED AS `20 → 13`. Taken literally it would SHORTEN
 * the estimate below the elapsed time, which flips the bar to overrun at the exact
 * moment it is supposed to be reassuring — and it is the only rung in an otherwise
 * strictly increasing ladder that goes backwards. Read as the transposition it plainly
 * is; if 13 really was meant, this table is the one place to change.

 *
 * ⚠️⚠️ EXTENDING AN ESTIMATE MOVES A NAIVE BAR BACKWARDS. At 7:59 the run is 80 %
 * of ten minutes; one second later the estimate is twelve and the same run is 67 %.
 * A progress bar that jumps back twelve points is read as an error, not as good
 * news, and it would happen at every one of the twelve rungs.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND A RUNNING MAX IS NOT THE FIX EITHER. Holding the previous value while the
 * new ratio catches up freezes the bar — nine flat minutes between 22 and 31, where
 * the ladder grows faster than the clock does. A frozen bar reads as a hang, which
 * is the thing this whole module exists to avoid.
 *
 * So the rungs are turned into a STRICTLY INCREASING sequence of ratios (each at
 * least `MIN_RATIO_STEP` above the last) and the bar interpolates linearly between
 * them. It never goes backwards, it never stops moving, it lands exactly on
 * `PROGRESS_CEILING` at the moment the ladder runs out, and at most rungs it is
 * within a point or two of the honest `elapsed / estimate`.
