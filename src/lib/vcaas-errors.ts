/**
 * VCaaS ERROR NORMALISATION.
 *
 * VCaaS answers `{ errors: { errorCode, errorMessage } | null, data }` with ~60
 * distinct `errorCode` strings (see `www.totalum.app/docs/api` — the published docs
 * are the only reference; this repo deliberately keeps no copy of them),
 * plus `403 VCAAS_INSUFFICIENT_CREDITS` from the credit gate in front of the whole
 * API.
 *
 * The UI must not switch on sixty strings. This maps them onto a small, stable
 * union that later phases can exhaustively handle:
 *
 *   INSUFFICIENT_CREDITS — out of credits ⇒ the insufficient-credits modal (upgrade / buy)
 *   PLAN_REQUIRED        — a paid-plan feature ⇒ the `<PaidFeature>` upsell
 *   PROJECT_LIMIT_REACHED — the account owns as many projects as its plan allows
 *   PROJECT_NOT_FOUND    — no such project FOR THIS USER (see the note below)
 *   RATE_LIMITED         — back off and retry
 *   VALIDATION           — the request was malformed; show the message
 *   UNKNOWN              — anything else; show a generic error with retry
 *
 * ⚠️ TWO OF THESE ARE NEVER PRODUCED BY `normalizeVcaasError` — `PLAN_REQUIRED`
 * (from `requirePaidPlan`) and `UPLOAD_QUOTA_EXCEEDED` (from the upload route's own
 * daily cap). They are PLATFORM refusals that never reach VCaaS at all, and they
 * live in this union for the reason the union exists: it is the one list of codes
 * the client switches on, and a platform gate that invented its own vocabulary
 * would be a code the UI silently falls through to "something went wrong".
 *
 * ⚠️ `UPLOAD_QUOTA_EXCEEDED` IS NOT `RATE_LIMITED`, deliberately. `RATE_LIMITED`
 * means "back off and retry" and the client's retry loop treats it that way; this
 * one is a 24-hour ceiling, where retrying in 1.5 seconds is pure noise. Same HTTP
 * status, opposite instruction.
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS MODULE IS SHARED BY BOTH RUNTIMES. It is pure (no fetch, no env, no
 * secret) so the client layer can switch on the same union the server produced.
 * Never import anything server-only here.
