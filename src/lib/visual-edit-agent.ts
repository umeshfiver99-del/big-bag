 * ═══ THE IN-PAGE AGENT (the visual editor) ════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * The script that runs INSIDE the previewed app and does the four things the
 * workspace cannot do from outside an iframe: hit-test a click, outline what is
 * under the cursor, describe the selected element, and apply a preview-only change.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT IS SERVED FROM OUR ORIGIN by the preview proxy, so it is same-origin with
 * the workspace and needs no privilege from the user's project. The project is not
 * modified in any way — see the proxy route for why that matters and for the
 * evidence that the template's own `ScriptExecutor` is dead code in production.
 *
 * ⚠️ EVERY MESSAGE IS ORIGIN-CHECKED IN BOTH DIRECTIONS. The agent only accepts
 * messages whose `event.origin` equals its own, and only posts to
 * `window.parent` with that same explicit origin — never `"*"`. An embedded page
 * cannot drive the editor, and the editor cannot leak into another frame.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT IS A STRING, NOT A MODULE, on purpose: it has to be delivered as a
 * standalone classic script into a document we do not own the build of. Keeping it
 * here (rather than in `public/`) means it ships with the bundle, versions with the
 * code that speaks to it, and cannot be fetched by anything that is not proxying a
 * preview.

/**
 * ═══ THE RUNTIME URL SHIM ═══════════════════
 *
 * ⚠️⚠️ WITHOUT THIS, THE PROXIED PREVIEW IS A BLANK PAGE. Measured against a
 * real generated project: `document.body` had **zero** text and 21 elements.
 *
 * `rewriteHtml()` fixes the URLs written into the HTML. It cannot fix the ones Next.js
 * computes at RUNTIME: webpack's `publicPath` is inlined as `/_next/` at build time and
 * the RSC flight payload carries *relative* chunk names, so the client runtime asks for
 *
 *     /_next/static/chunks/874-….js          → 404 (that is the PLATFORM's own app)
 *
 * instead of
 *
 *     /api/preview/<id>/_next/static/chunks/874-….js   → 200
 *
 * Every runtime chunk 404s, React never hydrates, and the page the user came to edit
 * never appears.
 *
 * ── HOW IT IS FIXED ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Rewriting at the *point of use*, which is the only place that sees the final URL:
 *
 *   · `document.createElement('script'|'link')` — webpack loads chunks and CSS by
 *     creating an element and assigning `.src`/`.href`. Both the property and
 *     `setAttribute` are patched, SYNCHRONOUSLY, because a `<script src>` starts
 *     fetching the instant it is assigned (a `MutationObserver` would be a microtask
 *     too late).
 *   · `fetch` and `XMLHttpRequest.open` — RSC navigations, server actions and the
 *     app's own API calls.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT MUST RUN BEFORE EVERY OTHER SCRIPT, which is why the proxy now injects it at
 * the TOP of `<head>` rather than at the end.
 *
 * ── THE SECURITY HALF, WHICH MATTERS AS MUCH AS THE FUNCTIONAL ONE ──────────
 *
 * ⚠️ The proxied document runs on the PLATFORM's origin with `allow-same-origin`, so
 * before this shim the previewed app's own JavaScript could `fetch('/api/credits/…')`
 * or any other platform route **with the user's session cookie attached**. The app is
 * generated from a prompt, so that is a prompt-injection exfiltration path to the
 * owner's own account data.
 *
 * Rewriting every root-absolute request to the proxy base closes the ordinary path:
 * the app's calls now reach the app. This is a strong mitigation, NOT a sandbox — code
 * running in the same realm can always undo a monkey-patch. The real containment is
 * that the proxy is only mounted while the editor is open; a dedicated preview origin
 * would be the better long-term answer.

   * writes 'text-[#ff0000]' — an arbitrary value, correct for the SOURCE, and
   * guaranteed to compile the next time Tailwind runs. But Tailwind already ran: the
   * previewed app was built and served by 'next start', its stylesheet is a finished
   * artefact, and a class nobody had written when it was generated matches no rule.
   * So the attribute changed, the pixels did not, and the user reasonably concluded
   * the feature was broken. The same applies to a stepped 'text-[3.6rem]', and to any
   * scale step whose class the project does not already use somewhere.
   *
   * The class is still what gets written to the file — that is the mappable, reviewable,
   * responsive-friendly edit, and after the rebuild it is what renders. This is purely
   * the stand-in that makes the intervening minute honest.
   *
   * ⚠️ IT NEVER TOUCHES A PROPERTY THE CHANGE DID NOT MENTION, and 'previousStyle'
   * records the element's own inline values so a revert puts back exactly what the page
   * shipped with — including "nothing".
   *
   * ⚠️ PREFIXED TOKENS ARE IGNORED. 'hover:text-red-500' and 'md:text-2xl' describe
   * states and breakpoints this element is not necessarily in; mirroring them as a flat
   * inline style would show the user a hover colour they cannot see the trigger for.
