/**
 * Derive ONE user-facing status from VCaaS's several independent status fields.
 *
 * A project detail carries three signals that can all be set at once:
 *
 *   `agentProcessStatus`  "init" | "done" | "idle"      — is the agent working?
 *   `agentServerStatus`   "Active" | "Creating" | "Starting" | "Archived" |
 *                         "Unarchiving" | "Archiving"   — is the sandbox VM up?
 *   `deployment.status`   "deploying" | "success" | "error" — is it published?
 *
 * The dashboard shows one pill, so they need an ORDER OF PRECEDENCE. We answer the
 * question the user is actually asking — "what is happening to my app right now?" —
 * so IN-FLIGHT work outranks steady state:
 *
 *   1. building   — the agent is mid-run (`init`), or the VM is coming up.
 *                   This is the only state where something is actively changing.
 *   2. deployed   — published and live (`deployment.status === "success"`).
 *                   ⚠️ This is the ONLY state in which `projectId.totalum-project.com`
 *                   serves anything, which is why the production link is gated on it
 *                   (`isPublished` below) rather than on the URL merely existing.
 *   3. running    — sandbox Active, not published. The preview works; the world
 *                   can't see it yet.
 *   4. stopped    — archived / archiving. The VM is down; opening it wakes it.
 *   5. failed     — the last deployment errored and nothing newer succeeded.
 *   6. pending    — we have no detail yet (the list endpoint doesn't return any of
 *                   these fields), or nothing above matched.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE LIST ENDPOINT RETURNS NONE OF THIS. `GET /vcaas/projects` gives only
 * `{ projectId, description, plan, createdAt }`. Status therefore requires a
 * per-project `GET /vcaas/projects/{id}`, which is why the dashboard fetches detail
 * lazily per visible card and renders `pending` until it arrives — see
 * `useProjectDetails`.

/**
 * ═══ THE CARD BADGE — TWO STATES, OR NOTHING ════════════════════════════════
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS IS NOT `getProjectStatus`, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS DELIBERATE. The six
 * statuses above answer "what is this project's condition" and still drive the
 * card's PICTURE — the shimmer under the chrome bar while it builds, the dimmed
 * screen when it is archived. The BADGE answers a much narrower question, and it
 * is the one the grid is for: **is something happening to it right now, and is it
 * live?**
 *
 * Everything else was noise. A grid of twelve projects showed twelve pills —
 * Running, Stopped, Pending, Failed — on cards where the pill was the only thing
 * with colour, and none of those four told the owner anything they could act on:
 * "Running" is the resting state of every project that has ever been opened, and
 * "Pending" only ever meant "the detail request has not landed yet".
 *
 * So there are exactly two badges, and no badge is the common case:
 *
 *   `promptRunning` — the agent is mid-run. The one genuinely live thing.
 *   `deployed`      — a deployment has succeeded, so the world can see it.
 *   `null`          — everything else. An idle, unpublished, perfectly healthy
 *                     project wears nothing at all.
 *
 * ⚠️ A RUNNING PROMPT OUTRANKS A SUCCESSFUL DEPLOY, because it is the thing that
 * is changing. A published project being edited reads "prompt running" while the
 * run is in flight and goes back to "deployed" when it finishes.
 *
 * ⚠️ "DEPLOYED, BUT ONLY IF NOTHING HAS BEEN PROMPTED SINCE" IS NOT IMPLEMENTABLE
 * AND IS NOT IMPLEMENTED. It would be the better rule — the badge would then mean
 * "what is live is what you last asked for" — but VCaaS gives us
 * `deployment.createdAt` and NO timestamp for the last finished run, so there is
 * nothing to compare it against. Guessing from `agentProcessStatus: "done"` would
 * be wrong in both directions: it is also "done" for a project whose last run was
 * a month before the deploy. If a `lastRunAt` (or similar) ever appears on the
 * project detail, this is the function to change and the comparison is one line.

/**
 * ═══ THE PREVIEW URL — THE ONE IMPLEMENTATION ═══════════════════════════════
 *
 * ⚠️ `developmentUrlFieldToUse` IS A FIELD NAME, NOT A URL. This is the single
 * easiest thing to get wrong in the whole VCaaS surface, and an earlier version got it
 * wrong here: the original version of this function had
 * `… || detail.developmentUrlFieldToUse || null` as its last fallback, which
 * would have returned the literal string `"cachedDevelopmentUrl"` and rendered it
 * as an iframe `src`. It also ignored the selection rule entirely by always
 * preferring the live URL. Fixed; the dashboard thumbnail and the
 * workspace preview now share this one implementation.
 *
 * The rule, quoted from the API reference (https://www.totalum.app/totalum-api.md):
 *
 *   "Use `data.developmentUrlFieldToUse` to decide which development URL to
 *    display. It returns the NAME of the response field containing the best URL
 *    for the current state. … If `developmentUrlFieldToUse` is null or undefined,
 *    always fall back to `data.temporalDevelopmentProjectUrl`."
 *
 * `cachedDevelopmentUrl` is a STATIC SNAPSHOT served while the sandbox is
 * archived; the live URL comes back once the server is up and a prompt finishes.
 * Callers must tell the user which one they are looking at — see `isCachedPreview`.
 *
 * ⚠️ NEVER CACHE THE RESULT. The docs require re-reading the project (and this
 * field) on: navigating to the project, a manual refresh, and **every time an
 * agent run reaches `done`**. The workspace does exactly that.
