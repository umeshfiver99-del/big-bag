 * ═══⭐⭐⭐ EVERY UPSTREAM URL MUST STAY INSIDE `/api/v1/vcaas/` ═══════════════
 *
 * ⚠️⚠️ THIS APP HOLDS AN ACCOUNT-WIDE KEY AND HAS NO LOGIN. The key authorises far
 * more than the VCaaS surface — API-key management, billing, account settings — so
 * the only thing keeping a request on the intended surface is that every proxied
 * path lands under `/api/v1/vcaas/`.
 *
 * ⚠️⚠️ AND A NAIVE JOIN DOES NOT GUARANTEE IT. Paths are built from route params,
 * which the framework hands over already decoded, so a traversal segment (dot-dot, in
 * any of its encoded or backslash spellings) can survive into the joined string; `fetch`
 * then normalises it and the request can land OUTSIDE `/api/v1/vcaas/`, on another part
 * of the account API the key also authorises.
 *
 * ⚠️ SO THE CHECK RUNS ON THE URL `fetch` WILL ACTUALLY REQUEST, not on the string
 * we built. Filtering dot segments out of the input is a losing game (encodings,
 * backslashes, double-decoding); resolving the URL first and then checking where it
 * points is the one test that cannot be talked around. Both request helpers go through
 * here, so no route can forget it.
