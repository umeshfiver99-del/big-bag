/**
 * ═══ THE SOURCE MODEL: WHAT THE FILES ACTUALLY SAY ═════════════
 *
 * ⚠️⚠️ THIS REPLACES REGEX MATCHING, AND THE REASON IS A MEASURED FAILURE RATE.
 * A user applied twelve visual changes to a real project: **two landed and ten came
 * back unmappable** — `not-found`, `low-confidence` and `ambiguous`, all three. Every
 * one of those failures traces to the same root cause: `visual-edit.ts` looked for the
 * *rendered* string inside the *source* text, and on a real Next.js + Tailwind project
 * those two strings are almost never equal.
 *
 *   · `<Button className="px-4">` renders `class="inline-flex … px-4"` — the DOM value
 *     is `cn(buttonVariants(), "px-4")`'s **merged output**, which appears in no file.
 *   · `` className={`${base} p-4 ${font.className}`} `` — the DOM holds a build hash.
 *   · `<p>Don&apos;t stop</p>` renders `Don't stop` — the source has an entity.
 *   · `<h1>\n  Two   words\n</h1>` renders `Two words` — the source has newlines.
 *   · A component file scored **0** for the route, so a *unique, obviously correct*
 *     match was refused as `low-confidence`.
 *   · Two identical cards → two identical class strings → permanently `ambiguous`.
 *
 * No amount of regex tuning fixes that list, because the problem is not the pattern —
 * it is that a class attribute is an **expression**, not a string, and JSX text is a
 * **node**, not a substring. So this module parses the file (TypeScript's own TSX
 * parser, already a dependency) and hands the matcher a structural model:
 *
 *   every JSX element · its tag · its attributes and their exact spans · the STATIC
 *   class tokens it contributes and where each one lives · its text children, decoded
 *   and collapsed the way a browser would · its parent, its siblings, its position ·
 *   and whether it sits inside a `.map()` (i.e. renders many DOM nodes).
 *
 * ⚠️ IT NEVER EVALUATES ANYTHING. `cn(a, "b")` contributes the token `b` and is marked
 * dynamic; it does not try to guess what `a` is. Everything downstream is built on
 * "the source says at least this", never "the source says exactly this".
 *
 * Unit-tested by `src/lib/__tests__/visual-edit-source.test.ts`.
