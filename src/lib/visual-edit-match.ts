/**
 * ═══ FROM A CLICKED ELEMENT TO A CHARACTER RANGE ═══════════════
 *
 * The matcher. It is handed the parsed source of everything the current route can
 * render (`visual-edit-source.ts`) and one `VisualChange`, and it answers with the
 * exact spans to rewrite — or refuses.
 *
 * ── THE THREE TIERS, IN ORDER ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *  1 · **THE BUILD TAG.** If the project was built with the template's source-tag
 *      loader, every element carries `data-tlm-loc="file:line:col"` and there is
 *      nothing to infer: the element IS that element. This is the only tier that can
 *      honestly be called exact, which is why the loader exists.
 *
 *  2 · **STRUCTURAL MATCHING.** For projects built before the loader (and for elements
 *      a component swallowed the attribute on), the element is identified by its
 *      *structure* rather than by string equality: tag, id, decoded text, the class
 *      tokens the source can prove, its ancestor chain, its siblings, and — decisively —
 *      whether the file is reachable from the route at all.
 *
 *  3 · **THE DATA BEHIND THE ELEMENT.** Generated projects put half their copy in
 *      arrays (`const features = [{ title: "…" }]`) rendered through `.map()`. The
 *      element's text is `{feature.title}` and matches nothing; the string the user
 *      edited lives in the array. Tier 3 goes and finds it.
 *
 * ── WHAT CHANGED ABOUT REFUSING ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * ⚠️⚠️ THE OLD SCORER REFUSED UNIQUE, CORRECT MATCHES, and that is most of what the
 * user saw. It required 45 points from a pool where a component file scored 0 for the
 * route and a merged class attribute scored 0 for the class — so an element that
 * appears exactly ONCE in the entire reachable source could be reported as
 * `low-confidence`. Uniqueness is now evidence in its own right: one structurally
 * consistent candidate in the files the route renders is not a guess.
 *
 * Ambiguity is still refused — but only after the tie-breakers below have had their
 * say, and after candidates that are the same source element have been collapsed.

/**

 *
 * The old table was ported from the legacy Angular editor and scored *string presence
 * within 400 characters of an offset*. These score *structural agreement between two
 * trees*, so they are not comparable and were re-derived from the failure set:
 *
 *   · `id` is still near-proof and still worth more than anything else.
 *   · TEXT is now worth almost as much, because it is compared correctly (decoded,
 *     collapsed) instead of as a raw substring — a heading's text identifies it.
 *   · CLASS is worth less than it looks, because a real class attribute is a merge the
 *     source only partly explains. It is scored as a *containment ratio*, not a hit.
 *   · REACHABILITY replaces the old `route` weight and applies to every file the page
 *     renders, not only to `page.tsx`.

/**
 * ⭐⭐⭐ A BUILD TAG IS EVIDENCE, NOT AN ORACLE, AND TREATING IT AS ONE WROTE TO

 *
 * ⚠️⚠️ THE STAMP DESCRIBES THE BUILD THE PREVIEW IS SERVING; WE MATCH IT AGAINST THE
 * FILES AS THEY ARE NOW, AND THOSE TWO ARE NOT THE SAME THING. The chat agent writes
 * source and the preview keeps serving the previous build until its rebuild lands; an
 * apply that fails part-way leaves files ahead of the running app. Any of that shifts
 * line numbers, and `file:line:col` then names *whatever element now sits there*.
 *
 * ⚠️ MEASURED, 2026-08-13. Shift a real page by a single line and re-resolve every
 * stamp on it:
 *
 *     media/page.tsx  +1 line → 23 elements:  5 WRONG ELEMENT, 18 safely-null
 *     hard/page.tsx   +1 line → 33 elements:  8 WRONG ELEMENT, 25 safely-null
 *     login/page.tsx  +1 line → 26 elements:  4 WRONG ELEMENT, 22 safely-null
 *
 * 15–24% resolved to a DIFFERENT element — and came back with `score: 10000` and
 * `reasons: ["source-tag"]`, the highest confidence the system can express. The edit
 * landed, the credit was spent, the bar cleared, and something the user never touched
 * changed.
 *
 * So the stamp now has to AGREE with what the agent saw. The three cheap checks below
 * are enough to catch a shift: a wrong element is almost never the same tag with the
 * same id and the same static classes.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT IS DELIBERATELY LENIENT ABOUT WHAT THE SOURCE CANNOT PROMISE. A component
 * renders a tag the file does not name, `cn()` merges classes the file only partly
 * owns, and a `.map()` template's text is a placeholder — none of those disagreements
 * mean the stamp is stale, and rejecting them would throw away the exact tier for the
 * very projects it was built for. Only a positive contradiction refuses.

 * only after tiers 1 and 2 have failed, and only for text changes.
