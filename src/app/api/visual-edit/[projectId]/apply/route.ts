/**
 * ═══ APPLY VISUAL CHANGES (the visual editor) ═════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * `POST { changes: VisualChange[] }` → resolve each change to a concrete file edit,
 * write the touched files, start a rebuild, and report exactly what could not be
 * placed.
 *
 * It is built entirely on **Feature 11's** endpoints — `files/tree`,
 * `files/content` (GET and PUT) and `rebuild`.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE SESSION IS THE ONLY IDENTITY. `resolveVcaasContext()` mints the caller's
 * own VCaaS key server-side; the body carries changes, never a user, a project owner
 * or a plan. A project the session does not own 404s upstream.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT READS ONLY THE FILES IT MIGHT NEED. Fetching the whole project would be
 * dozens of round trips; instead it reads the source files (`.tsx`/`.jsx`) from the
 * tree, capped, and searches those. The project-files API's server-side snapshot cache means those
 * reads are one upstream archive fetch, not one per file.
 *
 * ⚠️ NOTHING IS WRITTEN UNTIL EVERY CHANGE HAS BEEN RESOLVED. A half-applied batch
 * is the worst outcome: the preview would show some edits, the file history would
 * show others, and the user could not tell which. Resolve first, then write.

 * a constant in `src/assets/files.ts`, and every `.map()`-rendered feature list, whose
 * copy lives in `src/data/*.ts` rather than in any markup.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE OLD OBJECTION WAS RIGHT ABOUT THE OLD ENGINE. Widening the list for a REGEX
 * matcher would have meant searching bundler config, server routes and constants for
 * quoted strings — "a much larger blast radius for a wrong match". The new engine does
 * not search those files for markup: it parses them for exported constants and reaches
 * them only through the import graph from the page the user was on. A `.ts` file nobody

 * ⭐⭐⭐ THE BODY THAT SURVIVES THE BACKEND'S HTML SANITIZER.
 *
 * ⚠️⚠️ SOURCE CODE MUST NEVER BE SENT AS A UTF-8 STRING, AND THIS IS THE FIX FOR THE
 * `WRITE_NOT_FAITHFUL` REFUSAL THE CANARY BELOW WAS BUILT TO CATCH.
 *
 * the Totalum API backend mounts a GLOBAL `sanitizeMiddleware` — it runs
 * `sanitize-html` over every string in every request body before any route sees it. It
 * exists for user-generated HTML, but the VCaaS file-write route sits behind it too, so
 * React source posted to it is parsed as a web page and stripped to a tag allowlist:
 *
 *     PUT <div id="probe" className="flex gap-2">  →  stored <div>
 *
 * `className` is not in that allowlist (only `class` and `style` are), so it vanishes;
 * `<script>` is deleted whole. We measured this and — correctly — chose to refuse rather
 * than corrupt anyone's file.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE ANSWER IS NOT TO PATCH THE MIDDLEWARE. It guards every other route in a
 * multi-tenant backend the legacy platform still runs on, and carving a hole in it to
 * make one feature work is the kind of change that is discovered later by someone
 * else's incident. `PUT /files/content` ALREADY accepts `encoding: "base64"` — the
 * account-backend passes it upstream as `codeIsBase64` and the sandbox decodes it — and
 * a base64 payload has no `<`, `>` or `&` in it, so the sanitizer reads it as an
 * ordinary word and hands it through untouched. We use the door that is already there.
 *
 * ⚠️ `bytesWritten` STILL LINES UP. Account-backend measures the DECODED length
 * (`Buffer.from(content, "base64").length`), which is exactly the utf-8 byte length of
 * the source we encoded — so the free per-write check at the call site keeps working
 * unchanged.

 * attribute and an id are exactly what gets stripped. The timestamp stops a cached read
 * from answering for a write that never landed.
 *

 *
 *   · **It breaks the page outright when the element is a `next/image`.** The template
 *     ships `images.remotePatterns: [{ hostname: "placeholders.io" }]` and nothing else,
 *     so Next throws `Invalid src prop … hostname is not configured` — a runtime error
 *     that takes the whole route down. The user replaced a picture and lost the page.
 *   · **It makes their app depend on our storage forever.** The signed url is a Totalum
 *     artefact; their repo, their GitHub export and their Cloudflare deploy would all
 *     carry it.
 *
 * So the bytes are fetched once and written to `public/uploads/`, and the source gets
 * `/uploads/<name>` — exactly what a developer would have typed. It works for `<img>`
 * and `<Image>` alike, needs no `next.config.ts` surgery, and survives export.
 *
 * ⚠️ ONLY FOR URLS **WE** MINTED (`change.uploaded`). A url the user typed or pasted is
 * their explicit decision about where their image lives; silently downloading it into
 * their repo would be a surprise, and would also quietly re-host someone else's asset.
 *
 * ⚠️ A FAILURE HERE IS NOT FATAL. If the download or the write fails the change keeps
 * its original url and is resolved exactly as before — a worse outcome than internalising
 * it, and a much better one than refusing the user's whole batch over an asset copy.

     * We recorded an unexplained regression: a real project's `page.tsx` came back with
     * every `className` and `id` stripped and the rebuilt app was published unstyled.
     * It was reproduced on a brand-new project and traced, and it is not the matcher
     * and not `applyEdits` — it is the write endpoint itself. Measured, one round-trip:
     *
     *     PUT 179 chars  →  reported bytesWritten 103  →  stored 87 chars
     *     <div id="probe" className="flex gap-2">  →  <div>
     *
     * The cause is upstream, in the Totalum API backend: a global
     * `sanitizeMiddleware` runs `sanitize-html` over EVERY string in EVERY request body
     * before any route sees it. It is meant for user-generated HTML, and the VCaaS
     * file-write route sits behind it, so React source posted to it is parsed as a web
     * page and stripped to a tag allowlist. The tell is exact: `class="a b"` survives
     * (that repo allowlists `class` and `style`) while `className="a b"` does not, and
     * `<script>…</script>` is deleted whole, contents and all.
     *
     * ⚠️ WE CANNOT REPAIR THE DAMAGE AFTER THE FACT, WHICH IS WHY THIS RUNS FIRST.
     * Restoring a mangled file would mean PUTting the original back through the same
     * middleware, which strips it again. There is no second chance, so the only safe
     * move is to prove the endpoint is faithful on a throwaway path and refuse the
     * whole batch if it is not. Nothing is written and nothing is charged.
     *
     * This is a probe, not a feature flag: it repairs itself the moment the upstream
     * middleware stops touching this route, with no change here.
     *
     * ⚠️ AND IT IS RUN AT MOST ONCE PER PROCESS, BECAUSE WRITES COST MONEY. Measured
     * against the real API: `GET files/tree` and `GET files/content` are free, and
     * `PUT files/content` costs 1 credit — so an unconditional probe would put a credit
     * on every apply, including the ones it then refuses. Write fidelity is a property
     * of the backend deployment, not of the project or the user, so one answer serves

     *     names THIS batch (project + the change ids), so a retried request charges
     *     nothing the second time.
     *   · **Never on failure.** It runs only after at least one file was written —
     *     everything above this point returns early.
     *   · **Never blocking.** An empty balance answers `charged: false, insufficient`
     *     with a 200 and the edit stands. A bridge outage is caught and reported the
     *     same way. There is no branch here that can fail the request.
