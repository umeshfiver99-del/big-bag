/**
 * THE DIFF VIEWER — what the agent actually changed.
 *
 * ── HOW THE PATCH IS FETCHED ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `gitDiffUrl` on a conversation message points at EXTERNAL signed storage. The
 * browser cannot fetch it (CORS), and we would not want it to: an unrestricted
 * client fetch of a server-supplied URL is an open redirect waiting to happen.
 * It goes through `/api/vcaas/git-diff`, which is session-gated and keeps the
 * **SSRF allow-list**. That route is unchanged here.
 *
 * ── COLOURS THAT SURVIVE DARK MODE ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Diff colours are the one place a design system usually breaks: `bg-green-50` is
 * invisible on a dark background, and `bg-green-900` is unreadable on a light one.
 * Every colour below is an explicit light/dark pair, and the WORD-LEVEL highlight
 * is a *stronger* shade of the same hue so it reads as emphasis inside the row
 * rather than as a different kind of change.
 *
 * ── WORD-LEVEL HIGHLIGHTING ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The reference implementation does not have this. Without it, a one-character
 * change renders as two nearly identical rows and the reader has to diff them by
 * eye — which is the job they came here to avoid. See `diff-parse.ts` for the
 * algorithm and why it is prefix/suffix trimming rather than a full LCS.

/**
 * ⭐ TWO WAYS TO GET THE SAME PATCH, TRIED IN ORDER. ONE VIEWER.
 *
 * `url`       — a conversation message's `gitDiffUrl`: the patch the agent uploaded
 *               to signed storage when the run ended, fetched through the
 *               SSRF-guarded proxy above. Works with the project asleep.
 * `commitSha` — regenerate it with `git diff` on the sandbox. Works forever, but
 *               only while the sandbox is awake.
 *
 * ⚠️ NEITHER ONE ALONE IS ENOUGH, AND THAT IS WHY "VIEW CHANGES" KEPT FAILING.
 *
 * The stored patch is NOT kept: totalum-backend's `cleanupOldDiffs` prunes each
 * organisation's diff bucket to the newest 30 objects on every upload. The signed
 * URL stays valid for two years, so the link on an older run looks perfectly fine
 * and answers **404** — which surfaced as "the patch couldn't be downloaded, it may
 * have expired". The word "expired" was the one wrong guess: the URL had not
 * expired, the file had been deleted.
 *
 * And the sandbox route needs a machine that is running. Open version history on a
 * project you have not touched today — the normal reason to open version history —
 * and every single "View changes" answered `NO_ACTIVE_SANDBOX`.
 *
 * Together they cover each other: an old run's deleted patch is rebuilt from its
 * commit, and a sleeping project still shows any patch that was stored. Only when
 * BOTH are unavailable is there an error, and then it says which one.
 *
 * ⚠️ `versionId` IS THE BRIDGE. A chat message knows its `gitDiffUrl` and its
 * `versionId` but not its commit; a version knows its commit. When the stored patch
 * is gone and all we have is the version id, `resolveCommitSha` looks the commit up
 * in the version list — bounded, and only on the failure path.
