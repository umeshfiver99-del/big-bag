/**
 * GITHUB SYNC — a PAID feature.
 *
 * ── THE TOKEN IS THE WHOLE RISK SURFACE ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A GitHub personal access token is a live credential to someone's source code. It
 * is handled accordingly:
 *
 *   · the input is `type="password"` by default, so it is not captured by a screen
 *     share or a shoulder;
 *   · it is NEVER stored in this component beyond the submit, never logged, and
 *     never put in a toast or an error message;
 *   · the modal spells out the exact FINE-GRAINED permissions to grant, and links
 *     straight to the form that creates one — see the block above the repository
 *     field for why all three are required and why `repo` (a classic scope) was
 *     the wrong instruction;
 *   · `autoComplete="off"` keeps it out of the browser's password manager, where it
 *     would be saved as if it were a login.
 *
 * ⚠️ It is sent to VCaaS over our own proxy, which is HTTPS and session-gated. We
 * never see it again after that request — there is no "reveal token" affordance
 * because the token is not ours to hold.
 *
 * ── THE PULL IS NOT THIS MODAL'S ANY MORE ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `pull` returns immediately with `status: "pulling"` and the work continues on the
 * sandbox for minutes. This dialog used to own the request AND the 5-second poll —
 * ⚠️⚠️ WHICH DIED WITH THE DIALOG. The pull kept going; the polling did not, so
 * closing this (which is the obvious thing to do while you wait) meant never learning
 * that the pull had finished or failed, and nothing anywhere on the workspace said
 * the source was being replaced underneath the preview.
 *
 * The button stays here. The operation — its banner, its chat lock, its polling and
 * its survival across a reload — belongs to `WorkspaceShell`; see
 * `@/lib/project-operation`.

     *                      a direct push to a protected branch.

     * reconcile against a token page they have already closed.
     *
     * ⚠️ THE PERMISSION NAMES ARE NOT TRANSLATED, in either dictionary. They are
     * labels the user has to FIND on GitHub's own page, and a Spanish rendering of
     * "Pull requests" is a string that appears nowhere on it. They are `<code>`

/**
 * ⭐ WHAT TOTALUM WILL DO TO YOUR REPOSITORY, before you go and make a token.
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS IS THE QUESTION PEOPLE ACTUALLY HAVE, and nothing answered it. The modal
 * asked for a token and a repository and said nothing about what happens next — so
 * the branch model was only discoverable by connecting and watching commits appear.
 * Someone who then cloned the repo and worked on `main`, which is the branch git
 * checks out by default, would have their work overwritten on the next publish with
 * no warning that this was ever a possibility.
 *
 * ── EVERY LINE HERE IS VERIFIED AGAINST `startum-github-integration.service.ts` ──
 * Not against the API docs, which are close but not exact:
 *
 *   · `commitChangesAfterAgentComplete` — commit + push to `develop` after each
 *     completed prompt.
 *   · `pullAndSyncBeforeAgentStart` — pulls `develop` BEFORE each prompt and merges
 *     with `--strategy-option=theirs`. **GitHub wins on conflict**, which is what
 *     makes working on `develop` safe rather than merely tolerated.
 *   · `createAndMergePROnPublish` — opens a PR from `develop` to `main` on publish
 *     and merges it. ⚠️ IF THAT PR CONFLICTS IT CLOSES IT AND **FORCE-UPDATES
 *     `main` TO MATCH `develop`** — the one genuinely destructive behaviour in the
 *     integration, and the reason the warning below is a warning and not a note.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE BRANCH NAMES ARE NOT TRANSLATED. `develop` and `main` are literals in the
 * service and the strings people type into `git checkout`; a Spanish reader needs
 * the exact word, not a translation of it. They are interpolated as `<code>`.
