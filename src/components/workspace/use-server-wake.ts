/**
 * ═══ "YOUR SERVER IS WAKING UP" — PER FEATURE, NOT PER PAGE ═════════════════
 *
 * A project whose sandbox has been archived cannot be written to, rebuilt, published,
 * synced with GitHub or restored from a version. Every one of those endpoints now
 * answers the same way (`ensureServerActive` in account-backend): it **starts the
 * server itself**, charges it as a server start, and replies
 *
 *     409 { errorCode: "SERVER_NOT_READY", … poll agentServerStatus until "Active" }
 *
 * ⚠️⚠️ THAT REPLY IS CORRECT AND COMPLETELY USELESS ON ITS OWN. The work is already
 * under way; the caller just has to wait two to four minutes and ask again. Rendered
 * as `toast.error(response.error)` — which is what every one of these call sites did —
 * it reads as a failure, and the user's next move is to press the button again, which
 * spends another three credits on a server that is already starting.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS NOT `useProjectOperation` ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * ⚠️ THE PROJECT-OPERATION SLOT IS DELIBERATELY GLOBAL: it paints a banner over the
 * preview, locks the chat composer, and refuses every other long action for as long as
 * it holds. That is right for a publish the user asked for. It is wrong for this —
 * waking the server is a PRECONDITION of the thing they asked for, not the thing
 * itself, and taking the whole workspace hostage over it would be a bigger
 * interruption than the wait. So this is a small local hook, and the loader it drives
 * renders inside whichever feature triggered it.
 *
 * ── THE CONTRACT ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *     const wake = useServerWake(projectId);
 *     const response = await vcaasApi.deployments.deploy(projectId);
 *     if (wake.claim(response, () => void handleDeploy())) return;   // ← waking
 *     if (!response.ok) { …ordinary failure… }
 *
 * `claim` answers "was this the wake reply?". When it is, it starts polling and — once
 * the server is up — runs the callback, so the action the user actually pressed
 * happens without them pressing anything twice.

 *
 * ⚠️⚠️ REPORTED: pressing Publish / Rebuild / Pull / Connect on a project whose sandbox
 * is archived or gone "does nothing". It was very nearly true. `claim` swallowed the
 * refusal and restarted the strip's clock, and the strip lives at the bottom of the
 * panel column — off-screen for someone who just pressed a button in the header. The
 * user's only feedback was a progress bar they were not looking at jumping back to zero.
 *
 * ⚠️ A DOM EVENT, NOT A PROP, and for the same reason `INSUFFICIENT_CREDITS` uses one:
 * there are FOUR live `useServerWake` instances (the shell, the GitHub modal, the code
 * panel, the diff viewer) and threading a dialog through each of them would be four
 * places to forget. One listener in the workspace answers every refusal in the app.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT FIRES ON EVERY REFUSAL, INCLUDING THE SECOND AND THIRD. Pressing the button
 * again while the server is still coming up is exactly when the explanation is needed.
