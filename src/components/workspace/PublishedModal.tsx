/**
 * ═══ "YOUR PROJECT IS LIVE" ═════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * The one moment in the workspace that deserves a dialog rather than a toast: the
 * project has just become something the world can open, and the ADDRESS is the thing
 * the user now needs — to click, to copy, to send to somebody.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT IS ONLY EVER SHOWN FOR A PUBLISH WE WATCHED FINISH. Not on load, not from a
 * stored flag: the deploy watcher opens it on the transition to `success`. A modal
 * that appeared because a `deployment.status` field happened to read `success` would
 * greet every reload of a published project with a celebration of something that
 * happened last week — and would interrupt whatever the user actually came to do.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND ONLY FOR A PUBLISH. The other three operations (rebuild, pull, restart) put
 * the project back the way it was; there is nothing to announce and nothing to share,
 * so they settle with a toast. See `OperationBanner` for the part they do share.
 *
 * ── WHY THE URL IS THE CONTENT AND NOT A LINE OF PROSE ──────────────────────
 *
 * ⚠️ IT WRAPS, IT DOES NOT TRUNCATE. A custom domain clipped mid-word is the one
 * thing an address must never be — this is a value to be read and checked, and a
 * `…` in the middle of it makes the dialog useless for the only job it has.
