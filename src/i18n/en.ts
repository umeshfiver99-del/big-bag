   * The same three sections the marketing site runs on bigbag.app/whitelabel,
   * /api and /mcp — "Create it in only 4 steps", "It is just an HTTP API" and the
   * integration-help card — brought inside the product where the user already has
   * a key. The only deliberate difference: step 1 says COPY your API key, not
   * create one. In here they already have one, and the card underneath is it.
   *
   * ⚠️ THREE VARIANTS, ONE SHAPE. `whitelabel` / `api` / `mcp` all carry the same
   * sub-keys because `EmbedSteps` resolves them as `embed.<variant>.<key>` — a
   * missing key in one variant is a runtime blank, not a type error.

     * ⚠️⚠️ THERE ARE FORTY DRAFTS AND ONE IS PICKED AT RANDOM — ON PURPOSE.
     *
     * There used to be one. Which means the day this feature works is the day
     * LinkedIn's feed carries the same paragraph, word for word, under a hundred
     * different faces. That does not read as a hundred recommendations; it reads
     * as astroturf, and it burns the person who posted it more than it burns us.
     *
     * ⚠️ EACH ONE IS WRITTEN AS A PERSON TALKING, NOT AS MARKETING. First person,
     * one concrete detail (what it replaced, what day it was, how long it was
     * supposed to take), a bit of doubt or surprise, and none of the adjectives we
     * would use about ourselves ("powerful", "seamless", "effortless"). The point is
     * that someone can post it unedited without sounding like they were paid to, and
     * edit it without having to start from scratch.
     *
     * ⚠️ NO TWO OF THEM TELL THE SAME STORY. They are deliberately spread across
     * different people: the agency owner, the teacher, the shop owner, the ops
     * person, the sceptic who came to complain. Forty variations on "it was fast"
     * would collide in tone even while passing the uniqueness check.
     *
     * ⚠️ THE FORBIDDEN TELLS, all pinned by `social-share.test.ts`: the em dash
     * (the single most recognisable "written by an AI" mark in a social post), a
     * link to any BigBag profile, and anything that reads as a headline rather
     * than a sentence someone typed.
     *
     * ⚠️ EVERY DRAFT ENDS ON THE LINK, and hands off to it with a colon or a full
     * stop. Nothing appends the URL any more (that published it twice on X), so the
     * address lives in the copy itself and must appear EXACTLY ONCE. The trailing
     * position is also what lets `stripTargetUrl` lift it out for Reddit's title
     * field without leaving half a sentence behind.
     *
     * ⚠️ THE LENGTH BAND IS 200 TO 278 CHARACTERS, link included, and it is NARROW
     * on purpose. The ceiling is X's real limit: it cuts at 280 and counts any link
     * as 23, so a draft of length L costs L - 1 weighted, and 278 leaves a couple of
     * characters of slack and nothing more. The floor is the rule that actually
     * matters. A short draft reads as an advert and gets scrolled past; these are
     * written to sit near the ceiling, because the room is what lets a draft carry a
     * situation, a concrete detail and a last line worth reading.
     *
     * ⚠️⚠️ AND THE BAND IS NOT THE QUALITY BAR. Forty unique strings is not forty
     * different posts: forty rewordings of "I described an app and it was live" pass
     * every automated check and still read, in a feed, as one template with the nouns
     * swapped. So `social-share.test.ts` also pins that NO DRAFT REUSES ANOTHER
     * DRAFT'S SENTENCE, and that at most half of them open on "I". If you add one,
     * give it a situation nobody else here has.
